# Mission_to_Mars
In this assignment, we were expected to provide the following deliverables. 
- Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

We scraped the NASA website for images, titles and url for images of different hemispheres. The images were added to a dictionary. We utilzed Python, HTML and a Mongo database to display the information that was olleted for each image. Then, we utilzed Bootstrap 3 to enhance the responsiveness of the web app.
